# JavaAppletSnake
The classical and simple snake game in Java that can be executed as Java Applet.

As a believer of **"keep it simple"** I made this Java applet to revise my concepts of java applet, java and OOP after a long time and to do something fun with Java.

This was a fun, trifle project to do when you have nothing better to code at the moment and you realize that you have OOP Concepts in Java as a part of your course, and you didn't study it once, because you were busy with Assembly x86 and cramming stuff you don't like in CO.

There will be an update of storing high scores of users who play the game in this code, soon.
