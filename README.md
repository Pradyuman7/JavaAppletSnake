# JavaAppletSnake
The classical and simple snake game in Java that can be executed as Java Applet.

As a believer of "keep it simple" I made this Java applet to revise my concepts of java applet after a long time and to do somethign fun with Java.

This was a fun, trifle project to do when you have nothing better to code at the moment and you realize that you have OOP as a part of your course.
